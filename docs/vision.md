We've all been there. 
You're finally planning that trip to Thailand, and you remember meeting someone at a party who said, 'My sister lives there, I should connect you!' But now their name is just one of a thousand in your phone.
Or you're trying to find 'that investor you met at the networking event with blonde hair,' but you forgot their name. 

The truth is, our network is a junk drawer. It's scattered across a dozen different apps.

That's why we built Re:connect. It’s the 'second brain' that aggregates your entire network. 
A home for all your existing and future contacts from LinkedIn, iMessage, and Gmail.

It has 3 key features: 

Easy Exchange: We're making that first handshake simple. It’s like a universal AirDrop that works on any phone, even if they do not have the app.

Add Context: The moment you connect, our AI instantly enriches the contact with their name, location, and time of the meeting. You can then add a simple text note or a 10-second voice noted and our AI transcribes and files it.

Search Anything: All this rich context is now yours. You don't need to remember a name. You can search by concept, like, 'Girl I met at XYZ conference from UPenn who works at the US embassy,' and find her instantly.


Hi I’m Rion, a traveler with a global network I'm struggling to keep organized.
And Devansh forgets people easily. 

But don’t fret we are not a team of just helpless people but a mix with technical experts to make it happen:
Datta is our AI Engineer
Ravi is our scalability specialist
Eshwar, our security engineer will help ensure that privacy is maintained"

On one side, you have your phone's 'Contacts' app. It's basically a digital graveyard.

On the other side, you have enterprise-level CRMs like Salesforce. These are clunky, expensive battleships built to track sales quotas, not human relationships.

This has left a massive 129-million-user 'solution gap' in the U.S. alone made up of university students, young professionals, and freelancers. 



TAM: $34.1 Billion
19M students on student + × $60/year = $1,140,000,000
110M on professinals × $300/year = $33,000,000,000

We’re more than just semantic search on a list of ppl.

You don't have to start from zero ; we make it easy to securely import all your existing contacts from places like your phone or LinkedIn to get started in minutes.
