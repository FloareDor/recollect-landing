Here is a summary of Adam's key insights and advice for your relationship network operating
system startup.
🎯 1. Define the Problem by the Outcome, Not the Tool
Adam's primary advice is to shift your focus from data management to user outcomes. He notes
that personal CRMs have failed for 25 years because they frame the problem as data or
reminder management.
Instead, you should answer: "What am I trying to do with my network?". The product should be
built around helping a user achieve a specific goal.
* Examples of outcomes: Getting a job, moving to a new city, finding someone to date, being
more social, or finding people with similar hobbies.
󰳐 2. Pick a Specific User Base (and Pitch Only That)
Adam strongly warns against pitching multiple vague use cases. He states that VCs and judges
want to see specificity and intention, not a product that is "80% across 10 ideas, which is 0%".
You should flip your pitch: instead of starting with a solution and saying it can do anything, start
with a specific user and their problem.
* Prime Target: College Students: A "great example" is college graduates. They are meeting
many people and then suddenly disperse.
* Long-Term Value: If you capture users when they are 21, they are more likely to use the tool
forever. Older, more established people may feel they have already hit their "maximum level of
extroversion" and need the tool less.
📥 3. Solve the "Start from Zero" Problem
A critical missing piece is making onboarding effortless. Users do not want to start with an
empty network.
* The Hook: Your first step should be to "ingest everyone in your contacts in a safe and secure
way" in under 15 minutes.
* Use Existing Networks: You should allow users to import contacts from LinkedIn, Google, and
their phone. This immediately provides a model for the CRM to work with.
🚀 4. The 2-Week Pitch Strategy: Aesthetics Over Everything
For your demo, Adam's advice is to "fake it till you make it". The user experience and aesthetic
are "so much more important" than the backend technology at this stage.
* Use Your Own Data: Take your team's LinkedIn profiles and focus on visualizing that data in
an "auto-magical" and actionable way.
* Show, Don't Just Tell: Show how your tool takes a simple LinkedIn export and instantly
segments it by hobbies, jobs, and aspirational contacts.
* Focus on Visuals: He emphasizes that people "respond to, like, great visual content" and that
he has seen "million-dollar solutions" sold with "paperware and pretty screens".
* Demo "Parlor Tricks": Show flashy features like adding a voice note or taking a picture of an
event on the fly, even if the backend is "not stable and, like, definitely not secure" for the demo.
💻 5. Technical and Future-Use Advice
* Web First, Not Native: Start with a "dynamic web" app. Building a native app is a "real
commitment". You can use an Apple Shortcut to make a web app "look like an app" and "feel
like an app".
* Getting New Connections: Adam (as a user) says he would "probably" use your app for new
connections if it had a two-way sync with LinkedIn.
* Current User Behavior: His current networking flow is 70% LinkedIn QR code, 25% email, and
only 5% giving out his actual phone number.
