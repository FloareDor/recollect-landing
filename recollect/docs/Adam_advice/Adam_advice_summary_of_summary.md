Here are the one-line insights from Adam's advice:
* Focus on Outcomes: Frame the product around a specific user goal, like "getting a job" or
"moving to a new city," not as a generic "data management" tool.
* Target a Niche: Pitch a single, specific user base, like college graduates, as VCs prefer
"specificity" over a tool that tries to be for everyone.
* Solve "Day One" Value: Instantly solve the "start from zero" problem by letting users import
their existing contacts from LinkedIn or their phone.
* Demo Aesthetics Over Function: For the 2-week pitch, "fake it" and focus on "pretty screens"
by visualizing your team's LinkedIn data, as visuals sell better than early-stage tech.
* Start with Web: Build a "dynamic web" app first, not a native app, and use an Apple Shortcut
to make it "look like an app" on a phone.
