And you know, it's like the smoke and everything like afterwards. So, here's an example. I think
you're going to learn two things.
It feels intuitively easy on your skin. And it sometimes doesn't feel fun if you imagine it. You
know, like, watching a human or a robot trying to do laundry.
I'm like, that is like the most uncomfortable. Do you know what I mean? But when two or three
people are intertwined, the number one thing you're going to find is the issue that you're going
to get into. So, most people are going to get into that.
They have a conversation. But I think the main question is like, what is the problem that we're
excited to solve? Which we cannot solve. Right? And so, yeah, that's right.
So, you know, the key is you have to find something that's out there. Right? So, you have to find
something that's out there. We might have to get rid of it.
Right now. Because they can't get rid of it. But they always have to.
But we can't get rid of it. No. No? No, no.
I'm OK. I guess I've got a few questions. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And the first thing is, we have a lot of different features.
As a team, we're very passionate. People throwing different, like, crazy wearable stuff, too.
What stood out to you the most? What feature got you excited? OK, so let me tell you the
evolution.
So people have been trying to work on personal CRM for 25 years. Like, my entire adult
professional career, this is a thing that has been tough, right? Honestly, most people almost
default to, like, an air table or a spreadsheet at a certain point. Because it's just so fucking
expensive to have, like, an actual CRM.
You can be, like, $50 or $75 a month and do all the things you want to do. And then you have,
like, a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter. So, remember, what you showed with the NFC was
actually originally an app called Bump.
Bump. Right, yeah? And then there was this whole wave of things like Popple and other stuff
that were basically, like, scan QR code and something like whatever, right? Digital business
card. Yeah, no one uses those.
Like, in Asia, they actually use them a ton. But, like, in the U.S., depending on where your
market is, you just don't see it as much. So, the first thing is, like, I think you have to be... If I
were you, I would start with a process that people are highly motivated to put energies into.
So, raising capital, applying for jobs, right? Like, you know, like, moving to a new city, right? The
thing that I would tell people is that, like, we have so much more than, like, popping and
bumping stuff. So, like, I should be able to export my LinkedIn contacts, upload them into your
piece, and then all of a sudden I have a model, right? And then that CRM should tell me who I
can talk to and who I don't talk to, right? But it's also helped me with goals for everything else.
So, the thing I thought that was missing is that people always talk about this like it's a data
management problem, or it's, like, a reminder problem.
And the reality is it's, like, an outcome problem. Like, what am I trying to do with my network?
Am I trying to be more social? Am I trying to date someone? Am I trying to get a job? Am I
trying to insert the blank, right? And I think that area was missing. So, you started with a
solution, and then you resulted in the, like, you can do anything.
And instead, I would sort of flip that and say, okay, cool, you're new to a city. Here's a personal
CRM. Like, you are now doing job hunting, and you're going to meet a thousand people in a
network.
Here's your personal CRM, right? Hey, like, you are in sales, right? And you want something to
mirror all of it, because the company will otherwise own everything you touch. But I do think
you need to sort of think about, like, a specific user base that has an outcome. Do you have a
thought, Ben? So, it's, like, giving the personal type of information to the user.
Well, I think what I'm saying is the good news is all the LLMs will help you contextualize this
stuff. Like, they can now say, like, when is this written or article? What did they say on LinkedIn?
My guidance, too, is to not treat it like a lead in a sales effort. Like, I think what I'm trying to get
at is, are you trying to, like, deepen connections and, like, not lose touch? So, like, college is a
great example.
Like, you meet a million people, right? You know, as you get closer and closer to graduation,
you start getting less and less, you know, serious. Because you're like, I just need a breather,
and you wow out, and all of a sudden, you're done one day, and the next day, everyone's gone.
Right? And it's, like, disorienting, because you've never actually had to, like, do more than, like,
walk across the hall or WhatsApp somebody or whatever.
And so, for instance, like, if you decided this was going to be, like, again, the personal CRM for
anyone graduating anything, there's, like, a really specific program in that to do how to get
people forever. Right? Because if they build their networks when they are 21, you know,
graduating metaphorically undergrad, the chances of them having and wanting that tool
forever or never is, like, because remember, the later you choose the CRM, the less number of
years, the less subscriptions, the less motivation. Like, I'm at a point where, like, don't hear this
the wrong way, but I need, like, more friends or connections or anything.
Right? Like, I have, like, hit my maximum level of extroversion. And, like, I own a house that's,
like, in the woods in, like, the middle of 50 acres, and, like, no one talks to me. You know what I
mean? Like, you know, it's just like a dark sky, no cell phones, you know? And so I think you just
want to be a little bit more intentional about this.
Because I think you need to prove to me that, like, your network is the most powerful thing.
Like, to me, it's, like, an asset. It's like, hey, your network gets you jobs.
It gets you networks. It gets you awards. It does whatever.
People don't start investing in a network until they are 30 or 40 in a real way outside of
LinkedIn. Right? So how do we help you invest in the number one asset class you have, which is,
like, you and your network? And in terms of these different kinds of groups, so maybe
entrepreneurs, maybe college students, all these different things, would it make sense in our
pitch two weeks from now to, yes, definitely flesh it out and be, like, for this person, they will
use it in an S-Y-Z way. For this person? So a point of view is I have not had a lot of luck in
showing that there are 10 alternatives.
I see. See, VCs like specificity. Like, judges like a intention because they don't want to hear you
being 80% across 10 ideas, which is 0%.
Okay? What they want to hear you say is, hey, today, people need a better way to network
outside of LinkedIn. Here's the good news. Anything you have LinkedIn can automatically start
your PCRM.
Right? Because that's, like, everyone already, by the time you get to college, like, you have a
little bit of a LinkedIn or Zing or, like, wherever you are depending on where you are in the
country. Right? The reality, though, is that most people don't want to start from zero. So the
first thing you have to solve is, like, how do I not start from zero? How do I get, like, how do I
take my Google contacts? How do I take my phone? How do I take whatever? And I thought that
was missing because you should have said, listen, it actually takes you, like, literally 15 minutes
to ingest everyone in your contacts in a safe and secure way.
By the way, we will be hosting at AWS. We'll use private. Are you guys technical? Yes.
So you use, like, a private tenant, right, system, right? And you have, like, significant, like,
accountability to, like, not, you know, you have to sort of say, okay, cool. You now have a vault.
Right? Here's our destruction process at any time somebody says kick rocks.
Okay, great. Now I've started in less than 15 minutes and I feel really good that, like, my
contacts are in here. So, like, what's the first step? Well, the first step is getting a connector
coach.
And that AI tells you about, like, okay, is your goal to, like, find a job, a job, whatever? And it
coaches you through, hey, like, you know, you haven't really been active on SMS or WhatsApp,
right? Like, hey, you haven't really been sending anything on LinkedIn. You're sort of sucking at
posting. Right? Because to me, the personal CRM is as much about, like, personal brand
management as it is about, like, contact strategy.
But you've got to convince people that they will want to do that shit. So, like, in two weeks, if
you can just get, like, it's annoying. So LinkedIn makes you a request and then it gives it to you
the day after.
But just try to get 50 people to download their LinkedIn and, like, give it to you. Right? And then
build a stupid GPT just, like, one off it. Okay? If you want to get really crazy, you can put, like,
super base on the back or something.
But the point is just, like, and then run some really, really basic contact strategy. These people, I
think, you should focus on or you're, like, aspirational. Here's three guys you should ask for
mentorship.
For hobbies. Yeah, exactly. Here's who you play with, right? Like, it starts to break your life into
the segments and it's almost kind of, like, mining what you have.
And now all of a sudden, so, like, the other day, I was thinking to myself, like, there's this racket
sport called squash. And, like, there's now this, like, $15 million facility that just got put in, like,
the back of my neighborhood. And so, like, now all these idiot friends of mine are, like, we
should learn how to play squash.
And I was, like, okay. But I was, like, who else do I know that actually plays squash and is into it?
Or who do I know that likes, like, fishing or hunting? Or who do I know that, like, likes to travel
to California? And so there's all this moment about, like, really, like, working towards, like,
satisfaction and upward economic mobility. And there's also something to say for, like, similar
life stage or lifestyle.
Like, there's no CRM that tells me. Like, I have an 8- and 12-year-old, right? And so I've been
married for, like, 15 years. And, like, I could not tell you how old most of these people's likely
kids are.
I could not tell you if they actually live closest to me. I can't tell you if they, like, change that. It's
just too much to track in too many ways.
But, like, there is this moment to say, like, what are you doing to, like, not do it? Like, my wife is
really funny. She basically sent out, like, 50 different handwritten notes to build her, like, little
coven. And basically made her friends sign up to not be, like, waste of space and, like, come
and, like, meet up.
And they had to, like, mail her back something, right? But, like, it's really, really hard to kind of
maintain that level of enthusiasm. But, again, prove that it's really easy to get started so no one
starts with a zero network. Fake it till you make it in two weeks.
You're one of the few companies that can actually fake something and, like, focus on the
aesthetic. Because I'm telling you right now, if you show everybody, like, a LinkedIn export, and
then all of a sudden it's, like, hobbies and sports and jobs and whatever, you know, they're
going to be like, oh. And then you're like, yeah, of course it helps you stay in touch.
And, of course, it helps you do whatever. And, of course, it helps you plan stuff, right? But,
again, I think it's all about the outcome you want. And the outcome is get a job, find a
relationship, play sports, like, do whatever.
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. It makes sense.
It's a creative perspective. And you're saying to put the input, real user input rather than. Yeah,
like, take your LinkedIn profile.
Like, listen, take the three of you, right? You are a network, okay? So one of the things you could
figure out is, like, do you actually know the same people or not, right? And I think it's, like, are
you actually studying the same stuff? Three is, like, are you equally active? Are you looking at
the same jobs? Do you follow the same people, right? You can be, you know, they call it, like,
drinking your own champagne or kind of, you know, eating your own dog food kind of thing,
right? You can show people that. And because it's about the aesthetic and the user experience
here is so much more important than exactly how you get the job. All right.
But if you show people, like, an instruction card about how to set goals this month and how to
stay in touch and how to be connected and to be really easy. Like, I just had a guy who I love
dearly, but, like, I haven't seen him in, honestly, like, 10 years because he lived in, like, outside
of London and he just moved to upstate New York. And he was, like, he was in D.C. and now
he's going to be an entrepreneur again.
And he was, like, Adam. He's, like, what are you doing in life? And I was, like, I, like, genuinely
was excited. But I was also mad that it took me 10 years because I forgot how much I loved,
like, talking to this guy.
I was, like, he's super curious. He's interesting. Like, he does the same things.
Very good. I have one question. So, especially for the two weeks demo, so how important do
you think it is to make an app or, like, a PWA? If I were you, I would take whoever, who has the
biggest LinkedIn now? I don't know my number.
Yeah. So, if I were you, guys, I would take literally your LinkedIn, okay, and I'd focus really, really
hard on visualizing it. People need to feel it.
And remember how you're, like, oh, that's interesting. Oh, yeah. Okay, cool.
Whatever. Like, they need to feel how you take a simple input that is, like, auto-magical and you
really action it. Right? Because I would show them things, like, you know, this is going to take,
like, 30 minutes.
But, like, show them how you would hoard a voice note walking out and, like, a pencil on the fly.
Right? Take a picture of an event and, like, do the thing. Right? There are these, like, parlor
tricks that you can do and make it completely unsecure and, like, yeah, not stable and, like,
definitely not secure.
Do you know what I mean? But you can show this, like, a day in the life of and starting with us.
Right? Yep. And then, like, every person who is graduating.
So, if I were you, I would just, like, sit and temper. And I'd be like, hey, would you like a tool that
costs, like, $3 a month that helps you keep track of everybody that you're graduating with right
now? Without having to log on to, like, LinkedIn and whatever else. And I guarantee you, like, if
you can't get 100 people to say yeah, you would think about how powerful it would be if you
had a 100-person wait list in two weeks.
Yep. It's the more. So, I don't know if you overheard me earlier, but, like, basically, like, people
do not question you're going to be able to technically build this.
Right? They question you're going to be able to capture the attention of people in a window of
time. And, again, like, this is not a new problem. Like, I am your customer.
Like, I have, whatever, 7,500 connections on LinkedIn. I don't know how many. You know what I
mean? Like, whatever it is.
You know what I mean? Like, it's an impossible number. Right? And I'm at a place now, too,
where I am trying to connect with people more seriously. But, again, it's, like, just show it
aesthetically.
Like, make it feel like it's reverberating around. Okay, sure. It should be simple, but it should
have it.
Just do not underestimate how people respond to, like, great visual content. You know? Like, I
will tell you, I've watched people sell million-dollar solutions with paperware and pretty screens.
And people that were, like, I don't think differentiated.
Like, they failed every time. Okay. I mean, yeah.
And then you make an offer to, like, hey, if anybody wants to try this, like, send us your LinkedIn
and, like, we'll add you to the list or whatever. You know? My last question would be how
important do you think, like, do you think it would be important to have it as a mobile app or,
like, a website that you can open on your phone? I think realistically. Like, I mean, I would start
with, like, dynamic web in terms of how I would show it.
I mean, like, native is a real commitment. Yeah. It is.
You know? Starting from the web and then proceeding. But, again, I think it's all about, like,
automation that runs behind the scenes. Right? So, like, just, like, use, like, Lindy or N8n or
something to, like, fake how it could work.
Okay. And eventually you'll figure it out. Like, there's nothing in the next, like, whatever weeks
that you have to do in, like, the way you're going to do it forever.
And, like, whether you do, like, I mean, most people end up building, like, kind of generic
dynamic web and, like, React Native or whatever. Pretty easy. I do, like, Twitch updates and
everything.
I don't have to deal with app stores. Yeah, exactly. And also, like, you know, like, if you have,
like, again, do an Apple shortcut.
Right? That's the easy. That's, like, the lazy way to do it. You know? And then it looks like an app.
Feels like an app. Yeah. Exactly.
Last question. So, I understand this whole thing about the selling point being data
management. Oh, like, I have my network in LinkedIn already.
I'm going to put it in. I'm going to get value from that. Okay.
But do you find value in, like, would you use it for new future connections also? Oh, that's a
good question. I mean, here's what I will tell you. So, I think if you convince me there was a two-
way sync between your app and LinkedIn, the answer is probably.
I think realistically, though. So, then you're not commanding the app people? Well, I'm just
thinking about how I do it today, and I don't know if I'm the exception of the rule, but let me
just tell you what I do. So, I will tell you that I really, so, I keep burner numbers to give to
people.
Not, like, because I trash them, but because, you know, you meet a lot of people. I'm like, oh, I'd
love to, like, whatever. And then, eventually, you get to a person that doesn't read any social
cues, and they're like, what's your number? And I'm like, I'm not giving you my personal
number, so you can call me randomly about, like, whatever we were talking about, right? So, I
have numbers as part of my vCards that are not my real number, but I check them.
I have an app on my phone, and I do it. Okay. But my point is, is that, like, at this point, if I'm
serious about wanting to actually connect with people, which is probably, like, one in 50, then I
would just give them my number and be like, text me.
If not, I will be like, this is my email address, which is not, like, a disrespectful thing. It just
means you can put it in, and depending on, like, where I want them in the priority depends on
which of the 29 email addresses I give them. I will then say, the next thing is, I will pull up
LinkedIn, and I'll have them scan the QR code you get from the network, and that's probably
now about, like, 70% of the time, email's, like, 25% of the time, and phone number's, like, 5% of
the time.
But I do not, I do not, at this point in my career, use, like, LinkedIn to find people for the most
part, unless I'm looking for someone that can connect to someone. Like, so the other day, I
wanted to talk to the CEO of GoFundMe, which is a donation platform, so I pinged two of the
people that were, like, his direct reports in another life, and, like, that's how I do it, but that was
the extent of, like, how I use LinkedIn. Thank you so much for all your feedback.
Yeah, of course. We'll try to impress you two weeks from now. We'll do our best.
I'm excited. Good luck, yeah. Tell me.
Bye. Thank you so much. I'm glad I got GoFundMe.
