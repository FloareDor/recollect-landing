Here are the examples of exact wording Adam used for selling the product, taken directly from
the transcription.
* The Pitch to Students:
"hey, would you like a tool that costs, like, $3 a month that helps you keep track of everybody
that you're graduating with right now? Without having to log on to, like, LinkedIn and whatever
else."
* The Pitch to VCs/Judges (Framing the Problem):
"hey, today, people need a better way to network outside of LinkedIn. Here's the good news.
Anything you have LinkedIn can automatically start your PCRM."
* The Pitches for Specific User Bases:
* "okay, cool, you're new to a city. Here's a personal CRM."
* "Like, you are now doing job hunting, and you're going to meet a thousand people in a
network. Here's your personal CRM, right?"
* "Hey, like, you are in sales, right?"
* The Core Value Proposition (Selling the "Why"):
* "It's like, hey, your network gets you jobs. It gets you networks. It gets you awards. It does
whatever."
* "So how do we help you invest in the number one asset class you have, which is, like, you
and your network?"
* The Call to Action (Selling the Demo):
"And then you make an offer to, like, hey, if anybody wants to try this, like, send us your
LinkedIn and, like, we'll add you to the list or whatever."
